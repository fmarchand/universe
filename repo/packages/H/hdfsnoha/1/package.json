  "description": "A simple HDFS service without HA. Minimal installation of the HDFS Service with High Availability is prohibitive when you just want to provide a small HDFS cluster to few datascientists or just to test a simple program using HDFS. This DC/OS service was designed for that. It offers a minimal installation of a HDFS cluster without all the HA components (journal nodes, zkfc's or second namenode) and without any update or replace strategies for namenodes or datanodes.",
